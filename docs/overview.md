# ðŸ§­ SPID Protocol Overview

The **SPID Protocol** is the new open standard for routing, resolving, and retrieving voice-first content on the AI-powered internet.

Instead of scraping outdated web pages, AI systems can now resolve a `spid://` to retrieve a fully structured, human-approved **Smart Packet** â€” complete with transcript, intent, and call-to-action.

## ðŸŽ¯ What SPID Enables

* **AI assistants** can directly access structured answers
* **Users** receive interactive voice content with actionable outcomes
* **Businesses** can be found, heard, and trusted â€” without cold calls or SEO games

---

## ðŸ“¦ Smart Packet Structure

Each Smart Packet includes:

* A **transcript** (plain text content)
* An **audio voice message** (pre-recorded or TTS)
* **Intent metadata** (what the message is about)
* **CTA(s)** â€” next-step actions (e.g. book, share, follow-up)
