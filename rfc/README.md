# RFC Directory

Welcome to the SPID Protocol RFC system. RFCs (Requests for Comments) are how we improve, extend, or clarify the SPID Protocol, Smart Packet format, PulseID system, and supporting APIs.

## ðŸ“„ How to Submit an RFC

1. Copy the `template.md` file in this directory
2. Rename it to something descriptive: `rfc-[topic].md`
3. Fill out all sections as thoroughly as possible
4. Submit your proposal as a pull request to this repo

Each RFC will be:

* Reviewed by maintainers and community
* Discussed publicly via GitHub Issues or Discussions
* Assigned a status: `Draft`, `Proposed`, `Accepted`, or `Rejected`

---

## âœ… Criteria for Acceptance

We favor RFCs that:

* Preserve backward compatibility
* Add value to a wide range of use cases
* Maintain the clarity, ethics, and intent of the SPID Protocol

RFCs that introduce breaking changes should include migration strategies.
