# Welcome to the SPID Protocol Project 👋 

**We're building the open standard for voice-first, structured communication.**

Official spec, governance, and open standards for the SPID Protocol and Smart Packets.

The SPID Protocol enables AI assistants to retrieve live, human-approved Smart Packets — structured answers with transcripts, voice, intent, and CTAs. Think of it as DNS + email + schema.org for the AI Web.

## 🌐 What We’re Building

* **SPID Protocol** — a global identifier and resolver for voice-first content
* **Smart Packets** — AI-native answers with context, CTA, and structure
* **PulseIDs** — async voice inboxes for humans and agents
* **Open Specs + Tools** — to help businesses and developers publish retrievable content

## 🧠 Who It’s For

* Developers building voice-first or AI-interactive apps
* Small businesses who want to be found — and heard — by AI
* Researchers, standard-makers, and futurists
